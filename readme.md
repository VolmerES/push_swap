## Whatâ€™s about push_swap?

---

Sort a random list of integers using the smallest number of moves, 2 stacks and a limited set of operations.

You start with two empty stacks:Â **a**Â andÂ **b**. You are given a random list of integers via command line arguments.

Only these moves are allowed:

- `sa`Â : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- `sb`Â : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- `ss`Â :Â `sa`Â andÂ `sb`Â at the same time.
- `pa`Â : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.
- `pb`Â : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.
- `ra`Â : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- `rb`Â : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- `rr`Â :Â `ra`Â andÂ `rb`Â at the same time.
- `rra`Â : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- `rrb`Â : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- `rrr`Â :Â `rra`Â andÂ `rrb`Â at the same time.

At the end,Â **stack b**Â must empty empty and all integers must be inÂ **stack a**, sorted in ascending order.

## Whatâ€™s inside?

---

| Makefile | Automates software builds by defining rules and dependencies for make |
| --- | --- |
| Inc | Here is where you can find push_swap.h, where you can see all data structures that are used for the game data. |
| Libft | This is my own C library, with some standard and basic functions. |
| Src | All of my own source code. |

## How does it work?

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:VolmerES/push_swap.git
cd push_swap/
```

1. Compile:

```bash
make
```

1. Run the program, followed by the numbers you want to sort:

```bash
./push_swap 1 8384 123 3454 1231313 3434
```
